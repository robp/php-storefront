An e-commerce platform that I built from scratch in 1999. It boasted realtime
credit card processing, a store configuration wizard, product categories,
variants, and bundles, search, discounts with scale codes and ranges,
zone-based shipping with weight thresholds, customer login with address book, a
simple template system, and PGP-encrypted email receipt delivery. Not bad for
1999!

Modelled after Netscape's e-commerce platform at the time. We had about ten
customers on the system.
